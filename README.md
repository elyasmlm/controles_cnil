The CNIL is the French authority responsible for ensuring compliance with the GDPR by companies and administrations. It is the gendarme of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). This regulation strengthens the obligations of companies with regard to the processing of personal data.

Since 2014, every year CNIL publidh on data.gouv.fr the list of realised controls.

This project aims to make a website that valorise and exploits these data under the form of a map and graphs.
